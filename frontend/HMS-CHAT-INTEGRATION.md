### Health Support
```
User: "I'm feeling anxious about my upcoming appointment"

Aura: "I can sense you're going through a difficult time with anxiety. Your feelings are valid, and it takes courage to reach out. Would you like to talk about what's triggering these feelings, or would you prefer some immediate calming strategies? I'm here to support you every step of the way. 💜

Here are some gentle breathing techniques that can help calm your mind: Try the 4-7-8 technique - inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. 🤗"

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Backend Requirements**
Make sure your backend API is running with these endpoints:
- `/api/appointments` - Appointment management
- `/api/doctors` - Doctor information
- `/api/medications` - Prescription management  
- `/api/patients` - Patient profiles
- `/api/health-records` - Health records
- `/api/chat` - Chat functionality

### 2. **Authentication**
The system automatically uses stored authentication tokens:
- `localStorage.getItem('token')`
- `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')`
- `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`

### 3. **Test the Integration**
```bash
# Test the chat integration
node frontend/test-chat-integration.js

# Or test in your React app
# Navigate to the AI Chat page and try these messages:
# - "Book an appointment with Dr. Smith"
# - "Show my prescriptions"  
# - "I need help with my anxiety"
# - "What's the system status?"
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Enable/Disable Agent Mode
```typescript
// In SiriLikeAIChat component
const [isAgentMode, setIsAgentMode] = useState(true);

// To disable HMS agents and use only empathetic responses:
setIsAgentMode(false);
```

### Customize Agent Responses
The agents provide fallback empathetic responses when APIs are unavailable, ensuring your users always get supportive interactions.

## 🔧 API Integration

Located at: `src/services/hmsAgentService.ts`

Handles:

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The system gracefully handles errors:

1. **API Unavailable** → Falls back to empathetic responses
2. **Authentication Expired** → Prompts user to refresh/login
3. **Network Issues** → Provides helpful guidance
4. **Invalid Requests** → Offers alternative suggestions
